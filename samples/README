## CP.fits

A closure phase test.  The model consists of three uniform disk
stars located at various positions in the image as described below.
The position, sizes, and colors were selected to result in an
assymmetric pattern, thereby yielding non-zero closure phases.

Size: 128x128 pixels
Scale: 0.025 mas/pixel
Star 1: Location (1,1), Diameter: 1 mas, color: 0.5
Star 2: Location (0,0), Diameter: 1 mas, color: 1
Star 3: Location (-1,0), Diameter: 0.5 mas, color: 0.75

Image generated with SIMTOI.  Data generated with ASPRO2. The
